## Vision

### Backstory for the game:
The setting is Finland. The National Museum of Finland in Helsinki is preparing for it's annual and biggest exhibition. This year's topic is "Finnish Historic and Cultural Artifacts". 
These artifacts are stored all over the major cities in Finland, and were supposed to be sent by truck to Helsinki. This year, a very harsh winter has hit Finland and the
roads are all blocked by meters of snow! You are the best pilot in the country, and have been contacted by the museum, tasked with flying all over Finland to collect these precious artifacts. You have
limited time as the exhibition is only in 10 days. Only you can make the exhibition be a success!

### Type of game:
This game is based in collecting items. Items have different values. Before starting the game, the player is given a list of items that they must collect before time runs out.
If they manage to collect all the items, they win, if not, they loose.
